# simpleCounter

A tiny, single-page counter app built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project demonstrates a simple counter UI with easy-to-click +/- buttons and a Reset control.

## Features
- Large, accessible increase (+) and decrease (-) buttons on the sides for quick clicking
- A centered counter display
- A neutral Reset button pinned to the bottom to reset the counter to 0
- Responsive layout for smaller screens

## Files
- `index.html` — main page and app structure
- `style.css` — layout, colors, accessibility and responsive rules
- `index.js` — JavaScript handlers for increase, decrease and reset

## How to run
1. Open the folder in File Explorer and double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.
2. Or from PowerShell inside the project directory run:

```powershell
start .\index.html
```

## Live demo
You can also see a live preview hosted on GitHub Pages:

## Quick notes
- The app uses no build tools or dependencies — just static files.
- I fixed a script filename issue so `index.html` correctly loads `index.js` (which wires up all buttons).

## Contributing
Feel free to open a PR or add suggestions — great for small improvements like theming, a11y tweaks or keyboard shortcuts.
